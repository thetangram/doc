The Tangram documentation
=========================

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) *The tangram (Chinese: 七巧板; pinyin: qīqiǎobǎn; literally: "seven boards of skill") is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, which are put together to form shapes. The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only an outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap.*

We are a group of developers thinking that with the new architectures and technical approachs, as µservices and cloud computing, new challenges are arising in the user interface layer. Things like new browser based ui composition frameworks, like Angular or React, are growing fast. And some of all this new things are real interesting for us, like unidirectional user interfaces or fractal architectures.

But we feel like all this approach are directly focused on browser-based solutions. And we think in some cases a server-side based approach are not only required but best also. 


Project goal
------------

There are a set of technical principles and architecture approach related to **user interface composition**, like *isomorphic applications*, *unidirectional user interfaces*, *inmutable ui*, *ui orchestration*, *fractal architectures*, etc. But mainly all of the articles and implementations are talking about client-side. We are interested in evaluate a possible server-side implementation of all this stuff. 

That's why this project has **two main objetives**:

  - Create a **study group** to deep dive into all the things related to this **principles and architectures**.
  - Build a **proof of concept server-side implementation**, to evaluate the assumptions we'll get.
